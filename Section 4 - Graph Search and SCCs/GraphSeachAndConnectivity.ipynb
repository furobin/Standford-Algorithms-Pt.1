    "Bow Tie Structure:\n",
    " - Giant SCC \"Core of the Web\" - any webpage here, can get to any other webpage in this blob. \n",
    " - Out Group - numerous small SCCs that can be reached from Core but cannot go back to Core\n",
    "     - EX: Corporate sites. Policy for corporations is that corporat site hyperlinks can only reference other corporate sites. \n",
    " - In Group - numerous small SCCs that can reach the Core but cannot be reached from the Core\n",
    "     - EX: new webpages that reference pages in Giant but do not have references from Giant\n",
    " - Others:\n",
    "     - Tubes - Hyperlinks that go from In to Out without going thorugh Giant\n",
    "     - Tendrils\n",
    "         - Links that go out of In without going to giant\n",

    "Main Findings;\n",
    " - These findings, btw, scale to current day for the most part\n",
    " - 4 Parts (Giant, In, Out, and Others) are all abt equal size, each 25% of web\n",
    " - Giant Group is very well connected (\"small world\" property by Milgram)\n",
    "     - That is, to get from A to B in Giant, there are clues of hyperlinks to get there in p short path\n",
    "     - Also, following clues, this short path can be realized\n",
    "     - Think of getting from one wikipedia articlep age to another. \n",
    " - Things outside of the Giant are surprisingly poorly connected.\n",

    "Modern Web Research: \n",
    " - Temporal Aspects - How is the Web graph evolving over time?\n",
    " - Informational Aspects - How does new information propagate throughout the Web (or for blogosphere, Twitter, other social media, etc.)\n",
